## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
Thanks to the **QR card project**, I now have a clear understanding of when and how to use `margin`, `padding`, and `display: flex`. I had to refer to the documentation to fully grasp how `flex` works, but I’m confident that next time, I’ll be able to build layouts using `flex` without external guidance. Additionally, my understanding of the box model has improved, especially how `margin: auto auto` works.

### Continued development
After completeting this lessons, I got a chance to fill the gaps in my knowledge. I need to work on -
- HTML code semantics
- image related css
- `display : flex` and its properties

### Useful resources
- MDN docs
